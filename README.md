# Study-Group-Organizer

This code is the second version of the hk-study-group-organizer program, which was written in Typescript.

This version is written in Rust, which allows for better performance and more flexibility in the future.

The aim of version 2.0 is to provide a code base, that is not just a spaghetti code, but a well structured and maintainable code base.
